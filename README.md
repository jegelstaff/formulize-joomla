formulize-joomla
================

The Joomla component and plugin that integrates Formulize with the Joomla CMS

To "build" this package, the com_formulize folder needs to be zipped, and the plg_formulize folder needs to be zipped, and those two zip files need to be placed inside the pkg_formulize/packages folder.  Then the entire pkg_formulize folder needs to be zipped.  That .zip file can then be uploaded for installation in a Joomla 2.5 website.
